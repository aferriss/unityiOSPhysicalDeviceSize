Just attach this script to an empty game object and it will make some properties visible that you can use for the physical size of the device in meters.

As individual floats

`devicePhysicalSize.width`  
`devicePhysicalSize.height`  

or as a Vector2  

`devicePhysicalSize.physicalSize

This is cobbled together from [IRL-Size](https://github.com/detroit-labs/IRLSize/) and [SDVersion](https://github.com/sebyddd/SDVersion/)
